ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO THE COVERED WORK
(ISSUED PURSUANT TO SECTION 7 OF THE GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3.0)

These Additional Terms are hereby promulgated, published, and made applicable
to the Covered Work identified herein, and are intended to govern,
supplement, clarify, and, where expressly stated, modify the rights,
obligations, and interpretive principles otherwise established under the GNU
Affero General Public License v3.0 (“AGPL”). Except as expressly supplemented
or modified by the provisions set forth herein, all terms, conditions,
definitions, and operative clauses contained in the AGPL are incorporated by
reference and shall remain in full force and effect.

For purposes of interpretation, construction, and application of these
Additional Terms, the following provisions shall be read in conjunction with
the AGPL, and any undefined term used herein shall bear the meaning assigned
to it under the AGPL, unless the context clearly and unambiguously requires
otherwise. The definitions set forth in Section 1 below are provided for
clarity, convenience, and interpretive consistency, and shall apply without
limitation and without prejudice to any broader meaning reasonably derived
from context.

These Additional Terms are issued pursuant to Section 7 of the AGPL, which
authorizes licensors to supplement the license with additional permissions,
conditions, or requirements, provided such terms are clearly and
conspicuously stated. The Licensor hereby exercises that authority for the
sole purpose of establishing the supplemental conditions set forth herein,
which shall apply to all copies, modifications, derivative works, and public
deployments of the Covered Work.
• SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION.

For purposes of these Additional Terms, and without limiting the generality
of any definition contained herein or incorporated by reference, the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, it being expressly
acknowledged that such definitions shall apply uniformly, consistently, and
continuously throughout the entirety of this document, regardless of context,
placement, or subsequent modification: (a) “Static Site Hosting Platform”
shall mean any third‑party hosting environment that provides non‑dynamic,
non‑server‑executed deployment functionality exclusively through platform‑
assigned subdomains; (b) “Commercial Top‑Level Domain” shall mean any domain
registered under a commercially oriented TLD, including but not limited to
.com, .biz, .co, or any successor, derivative, or functionally equivalent
designation; (c) “Attribution Notice” shall mean a clear, conspicuous,
reasonably prominent, and non‑obfuscated statement identifying the original
author and source repository of the Covered Work; and (d) “Covered
Deployment” shall mean any instance, manifestation, or operational condition
in which the Covered Work is made accessible, directly or indirectly, to any
end user through any publicly reachable network endpoint, interface, or
mechanism, whether or not such access constitutes “conveying” under the
AGPL.

• SECTION 2. HOSTING, DEPLOYMENT, AND ACCESS LIMITATIONS.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the AGPL, any other
license, any oral or written communication, or any interpretation thereof,
Licensee expressly acknowledges, agrees, and affirms that the Covered Work
shall not, under any circumstances, conditions, interpretations, or
permutations, be deployed, conveyed, hosted, executed, or otherwise made
available via any Commercial Top‑Level Domain. Licensee further agrees that
Covered Deployments are strictly and exclusively limited to Static Site
Hosting Platforms utilizing platform‑provided subdomains, and that any
attempt, effort, or action to deploy the Covered Work outside such platforms
shall constitute an unauthorized use, unauthorized deployment, unauthorized
conveyance, and unauthorized access, each of which shall independently and
collectively be deemed a material breach of these Additional Terms and of
the AGPL. For the avoidance of doubt, any domain, subdomain, or hosting
environment not explicitly enumerated as a Static Site Hosting Platform
shall be conclusively presumed to be prohibited.

• SECTION 3. NON‑COMMERCIAL USE RESTRICTION AND PROHIBITED BENEFIT.

Licensee shall not, and shall not permit any third party to, use, reproduce,
modify, deploy, execute, or otherwise exploit the Covered Work, in whole or
in part, for any commercial purpose, commercial advantage, monetary
compensation, revenue‑generating activity, or any activity reasonably
interpretable as conferring commercial benefit, whether direct, indirect,
incidental, consequential, or derivative. For the avoidance of doubt, any
use that appears, is intended, or could reasonably be construed to attract
customers, generate revenue, support a business enterprise, or facilitate
commercial operations shall be deemed commercial in nature and therefore
strictly prohibited. This prohibition applies irrespective of whether the
commercial benefit is realized, unrealized, intended, unintended, direct,
indirect, primary, secondary, or merely speculative.

• SECTION 4. ATTRIBUTION, NOTICE, AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.

Licensee shall maintain, preserve, and prominently display an Attribution
Notice in all Covered Deployments, derivative works, modified versions,
public instances, or any other manifestation of the Covered Work. Such
Attribution Notice shall be placed in a location reasonably calculated to
provide notice to end users, and shall not be removed, concealed,
obfuscated, minimized, reformatted, or otherwise altered in any manner that
reduces its prominence, clarity, legibility, or interpretability. Any
attempt to remove, obscure, or diminish the Attribution Notice shall
constitute a material breach of these Additional Terms, a violation of the
AGPL, and an unauthorized modification of the Covered Work. Licensee agrees
that the Attribution Notice shall remain intact, unmodified, and fully
visible at all times during any Covered Deployment.

• SECTION 5. MISREPRESENTATION, DESIGNATION, AND ORIGIN DISCLOSURE.

Licensee shall not misrepresent, distort, obscure, or otherwise misstate the
origin, authorship, provenance, or derivation of the Covered Work or any
modified version thereof. Any modified version must be clearly, explicitly,
and unambiguously designated as modified, altered, adapted, or otherwise
distinct from the original version, and must not imply, suggest, or
represent, whether directly or indirectly, any endorsement, sponsorship,
approval, authorization, or affiliation by the original author. Any failure
to properly designate modifications, or any implication of endorsement, is
strictly prohibited and shall constitute a material breach of these
Additional Terms.

• SECTION 6. ENFORCEMENT, REMEDIES, AND CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS.

Any violation, breach, deviation, or non‑compliance with these Additional
Terms shall be deemed a violation of the AGPL and shall result in the
automatic termination of Licensee’s rights under the AGPL, subject only to
the reinstatement provisions expressly provided therein. Licensor reserves
all rights and remedies available at law, in equity, or under any applicable
legal theory, including, without limitation, injunctive relief, specific
performance, equitable remedies, and any other remedy deemed appropriate by
a court of competent jurisdiction. Licensee acknowledges that the
obligations, restrictions, and requirements set forth herein are continuing,
perpetual, and binding upon any Covered Deployment, derivative work, or
subsequent conveyance, regardless of whether Licensee believes such
obligations to be applicable, enforceable, or reasonable.

• SECTION 7. SEVERABILITY AND CONTINUED VALIDITY.

If any provision, clause, phrase, or section of these Additional Terms is
determined, adjudicated, or otherwise held to be invalid, unenforceable, or
void, in whole or in part, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum
extent permissible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions shall
remain in full force, full effect, and full applicability, without
limitation, impairment, or reduction. The invalidity of any provision shall
not affect the validity of any other provision, and all remaining provisions
shall be interpreted so as to give maximum effect to the intent of the
Licensor as expressed herein.
